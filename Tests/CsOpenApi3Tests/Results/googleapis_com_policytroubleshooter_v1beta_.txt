For example, `google.com` or `example.com`. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A single identity in a workforce identity pool. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id}`: All workforce identities in a group. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}`: All workforce identities with a specific attribute value. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/*`: All identities in a workforce identity pool. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A single identity in a workload identity pool. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/group/{group_id}`: A workload identity pool group. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}`: All identities in a workload identity pool with a certain attribute. * `principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{project_number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/*`: All identities in a workload identity pool. * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding. * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: Deleted single identity in a workforce identity pool. For example, `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value`.
