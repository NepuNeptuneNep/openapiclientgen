		/**
		 * Lists job triggers.
		 * See https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-job-triggers to learn more.
		 * Get v2/{parent}/locations/{locationId}/jobTriggers
		 * @param {string} parent Required. The parent resource name, for example `projects/my-project-id`.
		 * @param {string} locationId The geographic location where job triggers will be retrieved from.
		 * Use `-` for all locations. Reserved for future extensions.
		 * @param {string} filter Allows filtering.
		 * Supported syntax:
		 * * Filter expressions are made up of one or more restrictions.
		 * * Restrictions can be combined by `AND` or `OR` logical operators. A
		 * sequence of restrictions implicitly uses `AND`.
		 * * A restriction has the form of `{field} {operator} {value}`.
		 * * Supported fields/values for inspect jobs:
		 *     - `status` - HEALTHY|PAUSED|CANCELLED
		 *     - `inspected_storage` - DATASTORE|CLOUD_STORAGE|BIGQUERY
		 *     - 'last_run_time` - RFC 3339 formatted timestamp, surrounded by
		 *     quotation marks. Nanoseconds are ignored.
		 *     - 'error_count' - Number of errors that have occurred while running.
		 * * The operator must be `=` or `!=` for status and inspected_storage.
		 * Examples:
		 * * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND status = HEALTHY
		 * * inspected_storage = cloud_storage OR inspected_storage = bigquery
		 * * inspected_storage = cloud_storage AND (state = PAUSED OR state = HEALTHY)
		 * * last_run_time > \"2017-12-12T00:00:00+00:00\"
		 * The length of this field should be no more than 500 characters.
		 * @param {string} orderBy Comma separated list of triggeredJob fields to order by,
		 * followed by `asc` or `desc` postfix. This list is case-insensitive,
		 * default sorting order is ascending, redundant space characters are
		 * insignificant.
		 * Example: `name asc,update_time, create_time desc`
		 * Supported fields are:
		 * - `create_time`: corresponds to time the JobTrigger was created.
		 * - `update_time`: corresponds to time the JobTrigger was last updated.
		 * - `last_run_time`: corresponds to the last time the JobTrigger ran.
		 * - `name`: corresponds to JobTrigger's name.
		 * - `display_name`: corresponds to JobTrigger's display name.
		 * - `status`: corresponds to JobTrigger's status.
		 * @param {number} pageSize Size of the page, can be limited by a server.
		 * @param {string} pageToken Page token to continue retrieval. Comes from previous call
		 * to ListJobTriggers. `order_by` field must not
		 * change for subsequent calls.
