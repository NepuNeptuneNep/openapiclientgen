		/**
		 * An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
		 * controls for Google Cloud resources.
		 * A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more
		 * `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,
		 * Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
		 * permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
		 * custom role.
		 * Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical
		 * expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates
		 * to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the
		 * request, the resource, or both.
		 * **JSON example:**
		 * {
		 * "bindings": [
		 * {
		 * "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
		 * "members": [
		 * "user:mike@example.com",
		 * "group:admins@example.com",
		 * "domain:google.com",
		 * "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
		 * ]
		 * },
		 * {
		 * "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",
		 * "members": ["user:eve@example.com"],
		 * "condition": {
		 * "title": "expirable access",
		 * "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020",
		 * "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')",
		 * }
		 * }
		 * ],
		 * "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=",
		 * "version": 3
		 * }
		 * **YAML example:**
		 * bindings:
		 * - members:
		 * - user:mike@example.com
		 * - group:admins@example.com
		 * - domain:google.com
		 * - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
