	/**
	 * This represents a stat that's applied to a character or an item (such as a weapon, piece of armor, or a vehicle).
	 * An example of a stat might be Attack Power on a weapon.
	 * Stats go through a complex set of transformations before they end up being shown to the user as a number or a progress bar, and those transformations are fundamentally intertwined with the concept of a "Stat Group" (DestinyStatGroupDefinition). Items have both Stats and a reference to a Stat Group, and it is the Stat Group that takes the raw stat information and gives it both rendering metadata (such as whether to show it as a number or a progress bar) and the final transformation data (interpolation tables to turn the raw investment stat into a display stat). Please see DestinyStatGroupDefinition for more information on that transformational process.
	 * Stats are segregated from Stat Groups because different items and types of items can refer to the same stat, but have different "scales" for the stat while still having the same underlying value. For example, both a Shotgun and an Auto Rifle may have a "raw" impact stat of 50, but the Auto Rifle's Stat Group will scale that 50 down so that, when it is displayed, it is a smaller value relative to the shotgun. (this is a totally made up example, don't assume shotguns have naturally higher impact than auto rifles because of this)
	 * A final caveat is that some stats, even after this "final" transformation, go through yet another set of transformations directly in the game as a result of dynamic, stateful scripts that get run. BNet has no access to these scripts, nor any way to know which scripts get executed. As a result, the stats for an item that you see in-game - particularly for stats that are often impacted by Perks, like Magazine Size - can change dramatically from what we return on Bungie.Net. This is a known issue with no fix coming down the pipeline. Take these stats with a grain of salt.
	 * Stats actually go through four transformations, for those interested:
	 * 1) "Sandbox" stat, the "most raw" form. These are pretty much useless without transformations applied, and thus are not currently returned in the API. If you really want these, we can provide them. Maybe someone could do something cool with it?
	 * 2) "Investment" stat (the stat's value after DestinyStatDefinition's interpolation tables and aggregation logic is applied to the "Sandbox" stat value)
	 * 3) "Display" stat (the stat's base UI-visible value after DestinyStatGroupDefinition's interpolation tables are applied to the Investment Stat value. For most stats, this is what is displayed.)
	 * 4) Underlying in-game stat (the stat's actual value according to the game, after the game runs dynamic scripts based on the game and character's state. This is the final transformation that BNet does not have access to.

	 * These are the definitions for Vendors.
	 * In Destiny, a Vendor can be a lot of things - some things that you wouldn't expect, and some things that you don't even see directly in the game. Vendors are the Dolly Levi of the Destiny universe.
	 * - Traditional Vendors as you see in game: people who you come up to and who give you quests, rewards, or who you can buy things from.
	 * - Kiosks/Collections, which are really just Vendors that don't charge currency (or charge some pittance of a currency) and whose gating for purchases revolves more around your character's state.
	 * - Previews for rewards or the contents of sacks. These are implemented as Vendors, where you can't actually purchase from them but the items that they have for sale and the categories of sale items reflect the rewards or contents of the sack. This is so that the game could reuse the existing Vendor display UI for rewards and save a bunch of wheel reinvention.
	 * - Item Transfer capabilities, like the Vault and Postmaster. Vendors can have "acceptedItem" buckets that determine the source and destination buckets for transfers. When you interact with such a vendor, these buckets are what gets shown in the UI instead of any items that the Vendor would have for sale. Yep, the Vault is a vendor.
	 * It is pretty much guaranteed that they'll be used for even more features in the future. They have come to be seen more as generic categorized containers for items than "vendors" in a traditional sense, for better or worse.
	 * Where possible and time allows, we'll attempt to split those out into their own more digestible derived "Definitions": but often time does not allow that, as you can see from the above ways that vendors are used which we never split off from Vendor Definitions externally.
	 * Since Vendors are so many things to so many parts of the game, the definition is understandably complex. You will want to combine this data with live Vendor information from the API when it is available.
